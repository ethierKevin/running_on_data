Running On Data
A proof-of-concept full-stack web application that intersects my love for running and data analysis.
This app is a chance for me to showcase my skills and ability to learn new technologies while building something fun and potentially useful one day. As the project progresses, the backend will perform data analysis on the accumulated running data and metadata to provide race predictions, training insights, and more.

Tech Stack
Backend [Flask (Python) / SQLAlchemy (ORM) / PostgreSQL (Database) / Alembic (Database migrations)]
Frontend[React / Node.js / Bootstrap (style)] 
Deployment[Git/GitHub / Docker / AWS (future)]


Future Enhancements: 

Enhance the User Interface: Continue refining and improving the frontend for a more polished and user-friendly experience.

Improve File Uploads: Implement a more seamless and efficient file upload process, ensuring smooth parsing and insertion of data into the database.

Display Data on Frontend: Fetch query data from the backend and dynamically display it on the frontend, such as activity history and relevant stats.

Integrate Race Predictions and VO2 Max Calculations: Implement user-defined formulas to calculate race predictions and estimate VO2 max based on historical running data.
